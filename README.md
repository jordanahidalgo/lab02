# Lab 02 -- Chapter 01

## Define the followint terms:
* object, a variable, a data structure, or a function or a method, and as such, is a location in memory having a value and possibly referenced by an identifier.
* class, a specific instance of a class; it contains real values instead of variables.
* instance, in object-oriented programming (OOP), is a specific realization of any object. An object may be varied in a number of ways. Each realized variation of that object is an instance.
* method, in OOP is a procedure associated with an object. An object is made up of data and behavior, which form the interface that an object presents to the outside world. Data is represented as properties of the object and behavior as methods.
* signature, commonly identifies a method and usually includes the method name, and the number, types and order of its parameters.
* parameter, is a special kind of variable, used in a subroutine to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the subroutine.
* type, a classification identifying one of various types of data, such as real, integer or Boolean, that determines the possible values for that type, the operations that can be done on values of that type, the meaning of the data, and the way values of that type can be stored.
* state, the attributes of the object and by the values these have.
* source code, the only stage where a programmer can read and modify a computer program.
* return value, type (or result type) defines and constrains the data type of the value returned from a subroutine or method.
* compiler,  program that takes code written by programmers and translates it into a language a computer can understand.

## In Chapter 1 we have mentioned the data types int and String. Java has more predefined data types. Find out what they are and what they are used for. To do this, you can check Appendix B, or look it up in another Java book or in an online Java language manual. One such manual is at [http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)

## What are the types of the following values?

* 0 int
* "hello" string
* 101 int
* -1 int
* true boolean
* "33" string
* 3.1415 int. double?

## What would you have to do to add a new field, for example one called name, to a circle object?

## Write the header for a method named send that has one parameter of type String, and does not return a value.

## Write the header for a method named average that has two parameters, both of type int, and returns an int value.

## Look at the book you are reading right now. Is it an object or a class? If it is a class, name some objects. If it is an object, name its class.

## Can an object have several different classes? Discuss.
